ISD Lab Sheet Week 1 
 
Questions:  
1. What is a code repository (often also called version control system) used for?  
A code repository is used to store all source code as well as local or online repositories and source code version control. 
2. Why is it advantageous to use a code repository? 
It is advantageous to use a code repository because it makes you see the database as merely a detail of the overall application for example instead of bothering to set up a whole database you can just write a memory implementation that stores the data in a simple way, as said in the report from - (http://culttt.com/2014/09/08/benefits-using-repositories/), another advantage is that it is much easier for testing for example you can quickly edit instances in ‘IDLE’ instead of hardcoding that data. 
 3. Describe the different “layers” of Software that exist on a typical computer and explain why there are different layers of software. 
There are different layers of software that exist on a computer to translate different computer languages either to the user of the computer from the hardware or to the hardware from the computer user. 
 4. Describe what an algorithm is and explain why it is a useful “tool” to translate from a human level problem (we can think of) to a computer program.  
An algorithm is a set of instructions for a computer program to follow to carry out a task, it is a useful tool because it is the bridge between human language and the computers language. 
5. Write an algorithm that describes how to make scrambled eggs, try to use control words, like IF, WHEN, UNTIL, WHILE, WAIT, AND, OR.  
LIGHTLY whisk the eggs, cream and a pinch of salt together until the ingredients are just combined and the mixture has one consistency. 
Heat a small non stick frying pan for a minute, THEN add butter and let it melt, DON’T allow the butter to brown OR it will discolour the eggs.  
pour IN the egg mixture and let it sit for about 20 seconds without stirring, THEN stir with a wooden spoon lifting AND folding it over from the bottom of the pan. Let it sit for another 10 seconds THEN stir and fold again. 
repeat UNTIL the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places, THEN remove from the heat for a few seconds to finish cooking. 
6. Is idle (the Python language shell) an Interpreter or a Compiler or both? Explain your answer. 
Idle is both an interpreter and a compiler, for example you can execute a script as it is being read which means it can interpreter the script as it is being read and it can also compile script which means you can write a script then save it and then run it. 
 
 
 
 
 
Practical work using Python 
1) Write a command in the Idle shell that says “Hello world”  
>>> print ("hello world") 
hello world 
 
2) Write a program that produces the following output: Hello World I am in my ISD class right now 
>>> print ("Hello World I am in my ISD class right now") 
Hello World I am in my ISD class right now 
 
  
3) Write a program that asks the user for his/her name and produces an output like: Hi there, what is your name? >User input to be read< Hello (Users name) How are you? 
>>> username = input("oh by the way, what is your name? ") 
oh by the way, what is your name? logan 
>>> print ("oh well, thank you",username,"for using this program") 
oh well, thank you logan for using this program 
 
  
 4) Write a program that asks for two numbers (Python has all the basic mathematical functions in place, like +,- etc.), adds them up and displays the result. 
>>> numberone=input("please enter number one ") 
please enter number one 5 
>>> print("thank you, you typed in ", numberone) 
thank you, you typed in  5 
>>> numbertwo=input("please enter number two ") 
please enter number two 5 
>>> print ("thank you, you typed in", numbertwo) 
thank you, you typed in 5 
>>> numberone=int(numberone) 
>>> numbertwo=int(numbertwo) 
>>> result=numberone * numbertwo 
>>> print("the result of your multiplication is =",result) 
the result of your multiplication is = 25
